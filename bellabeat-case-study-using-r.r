The company collects data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health to empower women with health insights. Rapid growth has positioned Bellabeat as a leading tech-driven wellness company for women, with a strong digital marketing presence and global offices.\n\n### Bellabeat's Goal\nBellabeat enables women with health and habit insights through data collected from their smart devices.\n\n### Business Task\nAnalyze current smart device usage data to uncover consumer behaviors and trends, and use these insights to recommend high-level marketing strategy.\n\n### Stakeholders\n#### Primary\n* Urška Sršen (Co-founder & Chief Creative Officer): Sršen is keen on leveraging smart device data to unlock new growth opportunities and to guide the marketing strategy\n\n* Sando Mur (Co-founder & CEO): Responsible for strategy, finance and growth\n\n* Marketing Analytics team: Responsible for collecting, analysing, and reporting data that help craft effective marketing strategies and improve campaign performance.\n\n#### Secondary\nCustomers: Expecting high-quality, user-friendly products that provide valuable health insights","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Analysis Process\n## Task 1: Ask\n### Define the business problem and the questions needed to answer\n  \n #### Three key questions are:  \n1.

How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Task 2: Prepare (Collect and prepare the data for analysis)\n\n### Data Source\nThe data used for this analysis is Fitbit fitness Tracker data. It is a public data available on Kaggle.\n\n### Data Description\nThe data in these datasets was collected from participants who responded to a survey distributed through Amazon Mechanical Turk between December 3, 2016, and December 5, 2016. Thirty Fitbit users who met the eligibility criteria agreed to submit their personal tracker data, which includes minute-by-minute records of physical activity, heart rate, and sleep patterns.\n\n### ROCCC method\nTo ensure the quality and reliability of the data, I will be using the ROCCC evalution method, which stands for Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited.\n\n**R**: Provided by one of the co-founder, available on Kaggle by Möbius with 2275 upvotes and 140K downloads, CC0- Public Domain\n\n**O**: Dataset source https://zenodo.org/record/53894#.X9oeh3Uzaao, it is a credible published study\n\n**C**: The data appears complete, covering a wide range of activity metrics. Moreover, the device model of Fitbit is similar to Bellabeat’s product, which means the findings can be reasonably extrapolated to Bellabeat users.\n\n**C**: Dataset is 8 years old and was last updated 4 months ago, so it can be said that the data is moderately out of date but still can provide helpful insights.\n\n**C**: Data is cited on kaggale and the source citation is as follows:-\n\n   Furberg, R., Brinton, J., Keating, M., & Ortiz, A.

Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.53894\n   \n### Limitations\nThe sample size of the study is small it only contains 30 users. It is also not possible to ascertain whether the data is representative or biased because there is no detailed demographic information about the users such as age, gender and location.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Task 3: Process\n\n#### Let's begin with installing and loading necessary packages\n\n* install.packages(\"tidyverse\") #A collection of packages for data science\n* install.packages(\"dplyr\") #data manipulation, filtering, selecting, arranging, transforming\n* install.packages(\"tidyr\") #simplifies the process of tidying data\n* install.packages(\"lubridate\") #for date-time parsing\n* install.packages(\"here\") #for easy file referencing\n* install.packages(\"skimr\") #for data summarization, quick overview\n* install.packages(\"janitor\") #for data cleaning, naming consistency, table formatting\n* install.packages(\"ggplot2\") # For data visualization, plotting, aesthetics","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Next step is to load the packages\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(patchwork) #for combining visualization \nlibrary(RColorBrewer) #for color palettes\nlibrary(knitr) #for table formatting","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-27T12:48:48.099032Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-27T12:48:48.101203Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-27T12:48:49.584267Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read files to start the analysis process \n\ndaily_activity <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fitbit/mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv\")\ndaily_steps <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fitbit/mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailySteps_merged.csv\")\ndaily_cal <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fitbit/mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyCalories_merged.csv\")\ndaily_ints <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fitbit/mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyIntensities_merged.csv\")\ndaily_sleep <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fitbit/mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-27T12:49:10.064334Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-27T12:49:10.097876Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-27T12:49:10.668348Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Data Familiarisation\n\nNext I familarised myself with each data using head(), tail(), str(), skim_without_charts() functions.

Trends in smart device usage:**\n\nThe analysis reveals that nearly half of the users engage with their devices frequently, indicating strong user engagement. However, a significant portion of users rarely use their devices or have never used them, pointing to a potential gap in engagement. Users spend a substantial part of their day in sedentary activities, which could be attributed to office work or other low-movement activities. \n\n**2. Trends applicability to Bellabeat customers:**\n\nIt is important to note that the dataset lacks demographic information such as age and gender. Since Bellabeat is a woman-centric company, this limitation means that while the trends observed can provide valuable insights, their applicability to Bellabeat's target audience may be somewhat constrained. Despite this, the general activity patterns and usage trends can still offer meaningful direction for product and marketing strategies.\n\nThese trends provide insights into their daily routines and activity levels. The frequent engagement of a significant user segment suggests that customers find value in the devices. The high amount of sedentary time and low levels of very active minutes indicate an opportunity for Bellabeat to encourage more active lifestyles.\n\n**3. Trends influencing Bellabeat marketing strategy:**\n\nCampaigns can be designed to appeal to frequent users by highlighting advanced features and new product updates, while less engaged users can be encouraged through health benefits and integration tips. Timing content delivery around peak activity periods (lunchtime and evening) can increase engagement. \n\nMarketing messages should emphasise the benefits of increased physical activity, collaborating with fitness influencers to demonstrate product effectiveness. Additionally, educational content addressing sedentary behavior and promoting wellness can position Bellabeat as a leader in women’s health and wellness.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Task 6: Act (Recommendations)\n\n### Marketing Strategy: \n\n**1. Encourage movement:** Initiate programs and notifications to remind users to move regularly throughout the day to reduce sedentary behavior.\n\n**2. Educational content:** Provide educational content highlighting the health benefits of high-intensity activities and how users can incorporate them into their daily routines.\n\n**3. Promote active breaks:** Encourage users to take short breaks from sedentary behavior throughout the day to increase their very active minutes. Use the data to educate users on the health risks of prolonged sedentary behavior.\n\n**4. Activity challenges:** Create challenges or rewards for achieving higher active minutes, especially focusing on increasing very active and fairly active minutes.\n\n**5. Personalised activity plans:** Use the data to offer tailored recommendations based on users' current activity patterns to help them gradually increase their active minutes.\n\n**6. Improve Sleep Quality:** Promote healthy sleep habits to ensure users get adequate sleep duration and quality. Consider providing tips for better sleep hygiene.\n\n**7. Promote product features:** Highlight Bellabeat's standout product features, such as the 8-day long-lasting battery life, hypoallergenic materials, and waterproof design. Regularly remind customers of these benefits to encourage consistent device usage.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Product Strategy: (New Growth Opportunities) \n\n#### 1. Expand Product Variety and Customisation\n\n* **1.1 Fashionable Designs:** Introduce more fashion-forward designs with a variety of colors and        styles. Given that only 45.8% of users engage frequently with their devices, appealing to           different tastes and preferences could increase daily wear.\n\n* **1.2 Removable Straps:** Offer interchangeable straps to allow users to customise their devices for different occasions, from casual to formal settings. This would make the device more versatile and appealing as a daily accessory.\n\n* **1.3 Special Editions:** Create limited edition designs and collaborate with fashion and fitness influencers to attract trend-conscious customers.\n\n#### 2. Enhance User Engagement Features\n\n* **2.1 Activity Challenges:** Introduce gamified challenges and rewards to encourage more frequent use and increased activity. For example, users could earn points or badges for meeting daily step goals or active minutes.\n\n* **2.2 Interactive Notifications:** Develop interactive notifications that encourage users to move, stretch, or engage in brief exercises throughout the day, especially during peak sedentary times.\n\n ***Interactive Notification Examples:***\n\n*     Morning Reminder\n\n      Time: 9:00 AM\n  \n      Notification: \"Good morning, Aish! Start your day with some light stretches to boost your           energy. Tap here for a 5-minute stretching routine.\"\n\n      Interaction: When Aish taps the notification, a guided 5-minute stretching video is displayed       on her Bellabeat app.\n\n* Mid-day Break\n\n   Time: 11:00 AM\n  \n   Notification: \"Hey Aish, it’s time to move! A 2-minute walk can refresh your mind. Tap here to      start a quick walking session.\"\n\n   Interaction: Tapping the notification starts a 2-minute timer and tracks Aish's steps. A            cheerful message appears at the end, congratulating her on her activity.\n\n* Lunch Break\n\n   Time: 12:30 PM\n   \n   Notification: \"Lunchtime is a great opportunity to get active! How about a 10-minute walk? Tap      here for a fun walking playlist.\"\n\n   Interaction: Tapping opens a curated music playlist for walking or an audio-guided walking          session, encouraging Aish to move.\n\n* **2.3 Interactive In-App Features:** Enhance the Bellabeat app with interactive features like virtual fitness classes, real-time coaching, and progress tracking. This makes the app a central hub for users’ fitness and wellness journeys.\n\n#### 3. Improve Customer Experience\n\n* **3.1 User Feedback Loop:** Establish a feedback loop where customers can share their experiences and suggest new features or designs. This can help Bellabeat stay attuned to customer preferences and continually improve their products.\n\n* **3.2 Comprehensive Support:** Provide comprehensive customer support and resources, such as setup guides, how-to videos, and troubleshooting tips, to ensure users can easily integrate the devices into their daily lives.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Key Ideas To Executive Team:\n\n* Study Generational Preferences: Conduct market research to understand diverse fashion preferences of Gen Z and Millennials.
